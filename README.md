# BESS - British Enhanced Style Sheets

> Please Note: This project is not 100% serious, if you use this in a production product I would love to know - feel free to react out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheHarryET) - but this is only a personal learning project.

# Reference
This is a CLI tool that allows you to use british spellings of words in css and then transpile that file to a valid css file. This project also adds some convenience features in the future but look at the [Roadmap](#roadmap) for more info.

## `bess version`
Prints the current version of the software

## `bess input.bess output.css`
This runs the transpiler on your input function and spits out a valid .css file

# Roadmap
- [ ] Basic British English to Standard CSS Transpiler
- [ ] Variables
- [ ] Imports
- [ ] Nested Rules
- [ ] Maths?
- [ ] Mixins/Inheritance?
- [ ] Custom colours e.g. `colour: burple`
